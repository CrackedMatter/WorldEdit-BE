# Translation

Minecraft only understands ".lang" files when looking for text to use in the game. ".po" files are used here since they are more standard, and they are converted to ".lang" with [po2lang.py](../po2lang.py) when the project is built.

The main language used is English (US) in [en_US.po](en_US.po). If you want to contribute your own translations, please do so from the project's Crowdin page: https://crowdin.com/project/worldedit-for-bedrock
